# Progress: a personal voyage through programming exercises and challenges
Welcome to the repository of my personal studies on various programming languages! This is a dedicated space for continuous learning and exploration of different programming languages, providing a comprehensive and hands-on perspective for developers seeking diverse knowledge.

## Objective
The main goal of this repository is to share and document individual studies related to various programming languages. Each folder in the repository represents a specific language and contains code examples, simple projects, and study notes related to that language.

## Repository Structure
* /python
